# Final Project

### Few guidelines:

- Read and understand relevant research papers in the field of image super resolution. Select a paper to implement and dataset, get it verified by one of the mentors.
- Familiarize yourselves with the methods in the paper. Study their architectures, loss functions, and training strategies to gain insights into effective approaches.
- The importance of data and its quality- Collect or acquire a suitable dataset for training the super resolution model. It's crucial to ensure the dataset has high-resolution and low-resolution image pairs.
- Find out about training pipeline strategies like mini-batch training, optimizer selection (e.g., Adam, SGD), learning rate scheduling, and regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, batch normalization) to improve the model's convergence and generalization.
- Analyze the super-resolved images, compare them with ground truth high-resolution images, and identify common artifacts or limitations in their model's output. This analysis will provide valuable insights for refining the model
